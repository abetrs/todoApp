# todoApp
Attempt at building a user based react todo list app.

Feel free to make changes or make suggestions for better code. I am pretty new at this.

Setting up: 

```bash
# In case you don't have yarn
npm install -g yarn # takes 1 second.
# This will install the dependencies for the project. If you want to use npm. Don't.
yarn # or npm install
# On windows run
set TOKEN_SECRET="whatever you want"
# On mac and linux run
export TOKEN_SECRET="whatever you want"
# If you close out of your terminal or start a new session you will need to
# run the above commands again for the program to run successfully. 
# Another option is editing your .bash_profile on Mac or .bashrc on Linux. Or .zshrc if that's you thing

```
